                The Sorting Hat was a sentient magical hat at Hogwarts that determined which of the four school Houses each new student belonged most to. These four Houses were <span>Gryffindor</span> , <span>Hufflepuff</span>, <span>Ravenclaw</span>, and <span>Slytherin</span>. The Sorting Hat originally belonged to Godric Gryffindor, one of the four founders of Hogwarts. It normally stayed in the Headmaster's office until it was needed.
